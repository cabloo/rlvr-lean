"""What a check tells the pool beside itself, and what the pool tells a client beside its answer.

*Priority.* A client marks a check as background work with one request header. The proxy's queue
then takes it only when no normal check is waiting. Anything but the one value is a normal check, so
an old client and a mistyped value behave as they always did.

*Capacity.* Every answer that leaves the pool's front door carries three response headers: the
workers on servers that are up, the checks waiting for a worker, and the servers that are up.
``GET /health`` carries the same numbers in its body. They are advisory: nothing in the pool reads
them back, and a client that cannot read them keeps the number it was configured with.
