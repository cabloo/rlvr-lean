"""Generating ``haproxy.cfg`` for a pool: a server list in, a complete configuration out.

The generated configuration (HAProxy 3.0 syntax) has these parts:

* ``resolvers pool_dns``: how server names are looked up while the proxy runs.
* frontend ``lean_pool`` on the public port, the one address clients know. It answers
  ``GET /health`` itself, sends checks to the cache first, and sends them straight to the Lean
  servers when the cache is down. Every answer that leaves it says how big the pool is (the
  workers on servers that are up, the checks queued, the servers up); nothing reads that back.
* frontend ``checkers_door`` on loopback, where the cache sends what it could not answer.
* backend ``cache``: the cache service, with the checkers door as its backup.
* backend ``checkers``: the Lean servers, least connections first, never more concurrent checks
  per server than it has workers, weighted by what each server's usage agent reports. A check
  marked as background work waits here behind every normal check.
* listener ``stats`` on loopback: HAProxy's own statistics.

Given TLS settings (``PoolSettings.tls``), every hop that leaves the proxy's machine is
encrypted, TLS 1.3 or later:

* the public port serves HTTPS with the front door's certificate;
* every Lean server is spoken to over mutual TLS, health checks included: the proxy presents its
  client certificate and checks the server's certificate against the server's name in the list;
* the usage agents are asked through one loopback listener per server (``agent_tunnel_<name>``),
  which forwards over the same mutual TLS. HAProxy's agent check cannot speak TLS itself.

The hops that stay inside the proxy's own network namespace (the cache, the checkers door,
statistics) are on loopback and stay plain. Without TLS settings the configuration is plain
throughout, and its first line says so.
